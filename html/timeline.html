                    This was a new approach to the RL agent I created from 2020-2023. Since the work involving networking and attack actuation was already done from the last agent, this project went a lot faster. The biggest lift was integrating with other company services.
                    <br><br>
                    I created a logic system for the LLM agent to reference attack objectives, consult a library of available actions, read dossiers on the threat actor to emulate, track range information, etc. to simulate a user-specified cyberattack.
                    <br><br>
                    Compared to the RL agent, this one is able to carry out new attacks without retraining. It was made specifically to go with auto-generated attack reports I worked on earlier that year.

                    The goal of this project was to create an ML agent that could perform penetration testing on-demand at the level of a team of humans. All parts of this project were built from scratch, including building the attack actuation tools, writing executable payloads, setting up networking and communications, building the simulated network for training, writing the RL algorithms, training the agent, tracking experiments, generating after-action reports, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    We used RL techniques such as DQN, DRQN, ReF-ER, and hierarchical RL, with cybersecurity-specific modifications. We also explored approaches such as behavior trees, Bayesian techniques, and heuristics based on environment state.

                    CERN processes a high volume of streaming data from particle collisions (about a petabyte per second). In order to successfully deal with this data, you need several layers of reconstruction algorithms working across both hardware and software.
                    <br><br>
                    For this detector upgrade, we were increasing our luminosity even more, and required a new firware-level processing step. I developed FPGA algorithms to partially reconstruct ~100k collision events per second. My part of the firmware was in charge of segmenting and storing detections, flushing old detections, and performing simple pattern matching at nanosecond time scales.

                    This work was for CLIC, a proposed linear collider. We were interested in seeing how particle reconstruction and identification could be improved using CLIC's new, more-granular, calorimeter geometry.
                    <br><br>
                    I lead a team of nine researchers for this project, and presented results at international workshops and seminars, including NeurIPS.
                    <br><br>
                    The work involved training vision recognition algorithms on point-cloud data from simulated decay showers in the CLIC calorimeters. We created algorithms that could determine particle decay type, estimate particle energy, and reconstruct flight trajectory. We improved classification accuracies over existing techniques by over 40x in certain energy regimes useful for next-gen physics searches.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, we showed that the tool could be adapted for use in existing detectors with non-uniform calorimeter geometries, like ATLAS and CMS, still outperforming existing reconstruction algorithms.
                    <br><br>
                    We also created another GAN-based tool that could generate simulated calorimeter showers. This was to decrease computational load for event simulation, which took up most of CERN's computing resources.
                    <br><br>

                    With an LHC luminosity upgrade coming up, CERN needed to improve most of its reconstruction algorithms to deal with the larger volume of data. In a typical event, where two bunches of protons cross with each other, multiple collisions can occur. This problem would be greatly exacerbated by the higher luminosity, requiring better algorithms to reconstruct the separate collision vertices.
                    <br><br>
                    I applied unsupervised clustering and FFT-based techniques on 3D voxelated data to improve our vertex finding, improving reconstruction efficiency and computing time over the previous best algorithm. I presented this work at several international conferences.

                    I worked on developing focusing and detection planes for the third-generation photon detector upgrade in the South Pole Telescope. This upgrade aimed to maximize light collection at three sub-millimeter wavelengths, in order to gather more data about early universe conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    I designed, simulated, manufactured, and tested sub-millimeter wavelength optical components including circuitry and lenses. We ended up manufacturing the lenses via thermoforming, bonding together three separate plastic layers into a single lens with optimal performance characteristics.

                    Our lab was interested in creating and measuring the properties of metamaterials, which were materials grown in such a way that they had interesting optical properties. My project involved epitaxially grown silver, where there were very few grain boundaries in the atomic structure.
                    <br><br>
                    In this work, I set up and operated a laser system for launching plasmonic resonances on a target material. We tested plasmon propagation distances on epitaxial silver and thermally-deposited silver, showing longer propagation in the epitaxial material in accordance with theory.
                    <br><br>
                    For this project I worked with thermal vapor deposition, characterized materials with ellipsometry, set up femtosecond optics systems, worked with cryogenics, etched grooves with electron beam microscopy, and used AFM microscopy.

                    In this project we investigated copper-catalytic growth of monolayer graphene using RF heating in a zero-flow gas environment. In other words, we flowed gas over a hot piece of copper, growing single layers of graphene with as few grain boundaries as possible.
                    <br><br>
                    I helped assemble the vapor deposition chamber, the RF heating system, and the ultra-high vacuum system. I ran growth tests and performed analysis using Raman spectroscopy and SEM imaging.
